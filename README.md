## Explainatory Data Analysis Using Python

 - Zomato Resturant Analysis ([<img src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/48/000000/code.png"/>](https://jovian.ai/raghu-rayirath/zomato-dataset-eda-visualizations-v1)):
    - Analyzed over 9000 restaurants with over 20 features.
    - Performed data analysis using Python(pandas, numpy) and building visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly
    - Identified best ‘Breakfast’, ‘Fast Food’ and ‘Ice Cream’ parlours in various localities.
    - I used Plotly to build interactive visualizations.
 
 
 
 - Amazon's Top 50 bestselling books from 2009 to 2019 ([<img src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/48/000000/code.png"/>](https://jovian.ai/raghu-rayirath/amazon-bestselling-books-eda-plotly-visualizations-v1)):
    - Amazon book sales data from 2009 to 2019 was examined. The dataset contains seven features. 
    - The features such as "User Rating," "User Reviews," "Price,"  Year, Genre, etc.
    - I use Python frameworks such as Pandas and Numpy to perform data exploration and understand the dataset deeply.
    - used python visualization libraries to understand the dataset visually, such as distribution of the dataset and its features (User Rating, Reviews, Price, Year, Genre, etc.).
    - Build interactive visuals using Plotly, used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations (BarPlot, PieChart, Countplot, Scatter Plot, RegPlot, and so on).
    - I performed analyses such as "best sellers," "fiction sellers vs. non-fiction sellers," "best authors,", "yearwise best sellers," etc..
    - I derived unique insights from the dataset and visualized them clearly.
